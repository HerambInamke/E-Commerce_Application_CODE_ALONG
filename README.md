Ecommerce-Follow-Along

#### **Description and Summary**

Welcome to the **Ecommerce-Follow-Along** project! It's an exciting, mentor-guided journey in which we build a complete e-commerce platform with the MERN stack. Through this process, we will engage in creating scalable APIs, securing authentication, creating database schemas, and setting up the backend in Node.js using Express.

By this point, you are pretty comfortable with React; hence we'll be using that to come up with an interactive and responsive frontend. Throughout the way, we'll integrate all the disparate parts into a fully working full-stack application which is secure to use.

##  **Milestone 1: Project Overview**
### Why the MERN Stack?   The MERN stack is one of the most popularly used full stacks in web development for the following reasons:
- It is built using **JavaScript** throughout (frontend + backend), making it beginner-friendly.  
- Every component is powerful yet lightweight, letting us build modern, scalable web applications.
 
Here's what MERN contains:  
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database to store our application data.  
- **Express**: A framework for building the backend logic.  
- **React**: A library for building our user interface.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.

### **What I have Build**  

#### **REST API Structure and Endpoints**  
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) let the frontend and backend communicate. We’ll build a REST API that supports:  
1. **User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and log in securely.  
2. **Product Management**: Adding, updating, and retrieving product details.
3. Order Handling:  Seamless handling of customer orders.

The APIs would connect to our MongoDB database and get data back out, returning data formatted in JSON-JSON makes them more accessible and thus easier to be tested.

#### Database Schema Design
The databases are an absolute necessity to having everything go properly. For this MongoDB project:  
- Define all your collections: examples include products, users, or orders.
 Structure relationships that have to do with features like: user orders as well as products categories.

#### **Role of Authentication**  
Authentication is all about verifying who the user is. It’s what keeps an e-commerce site safe and ensures users can make purchases, view orders, or access personal data securely. We’ll implement secure login and registration features that protect sensitive information.
