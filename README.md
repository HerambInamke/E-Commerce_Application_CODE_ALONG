Ecommerce-Follow-Along

#### **Description and Summary**

Welcome to the **Ecommerce-Follow-Along** project! It's an exciting, mentor-guided journey in which we build a complete e-commerce platform with the MERN stack. Through this process, we will engage in creating scalable APIs, securing authentication, creating database schemas, and setting up the backend in Node.js using Express.

---
##  **Milestone 1: Project Overview**
### Why the MERN Stack?   The MERN stack is one of the most popularly used full stacks in web development for the following reasons:
- It is built using **JavaScript** throughout (frontend + backend), making it beginner-friendly.  
- Every component is powerful yet lightweight, letting us build modern, scalable web applications.
 
Here's what MERN contains:  
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database to store our application data.  
- **Express**: A framework for building the backend logic.  
- **React**: A library for building our user interface.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.  

---

### **What This Project Builds**  

#### **REST API Structure and Endpoints**  
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) let the frontend and backend communicate. We’ll build a REST API that supports:  
1. **User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and log in securely.  
2. **Product Management**: Adding, updating, and retrieving product details.
3. Order Handling:  Seamless handling of customer orders.

The APIs would connect to our MongoDB database and get data back out, returning data formatted in JSON-JSON makes them more accessible and thus easier to be tested.

#### Database Schema Design
The databases are an absolute necessity to having everything go properly. For this MongoDB project:  
- Define all your collections: examples include products, users, or orders.
 Structure relationships that have to do with features like: user orders as well as products categories.

#### **Role of Authentication**  
Authentication is all about verifying who the user is. It’s what keeps an e-commerce site safe and ensures users can make purchases, view orders, or access personal data securely. We’ll implement secure login and registration features that protect sensitive information.

---

### **What I Learned**  
This project will help you:
- Design scalable APIs for real-world applications.
- Build a strong backend using Node.js and Express.
- Design structured databases with MongoDB. 
- Implement secure authentication mechanisms. 
- Use React to build a modern, user-friendly interface.

### **Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page** 

Day 2: Login Page Implementation
What I Did Today
On Day 2 of the follow-along project, I worked on implementing a LoginPage component using React. Below are the details of what was accomplished:

Key Features
State Management:

Utilized the useState hook to manage user credentials (email and password).
Dynamic Input Handling:

Added a handleChange function to dynamically update the state as the user types in the form fields.
Form Submission:

Created a handleClickLogin function to handle form submission. (Currently, API integration is commented out for future implementation.)
Responsive Design:

Designed the login page using Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive layout.

```const [credentials, setCreds] = useState({
  email: "",
  password: ""
});

const handleChange = (event) => {
  const { name, value } = event.target;
  setCreds({
    ...credentials,
    [name]: value
  });
};

const handleClickLogin = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log("Submitted Credentials:", credentials);
};
```

User Interface
The login page includes:
Email Input Field: For users to enter their email address.
Password Input Field: For users to enter their password.
Submit Button: To initiate the login process.
Challenges Faced
Tailwind CSS Setup:

Ensured the Tailwind setup was correctly configured in tailwind.config.js.
Imported required Tailwind directives in the project’s main CSS file.
Backend API Integration:

While initially planning to use Axios, API integration is postponed, and the Axios import is commented out for now.
Next Steps
Integrate backend API for user authentication.
Implement proper error handling and form validation.
Enhance UI/UX by displaying success or error messages after login attempts.

# Milestone 3: Backend Project Setup and Key Features

## Overview
In this milestone, I have successfully implemented several key features for the backend of the project. These include the organization of the backend folder structure, setting up the Node.js server, integrating MongoDB, and implementing error handling. Below is a detailed breakdown of each accomplishment.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Backend Folder Structure**
I have meticulously organized the backend project files, creating a well-defined hierarchy to ensure a clean and manageable codebase. This structure includes separate directories for:
- **Routes**
- **Controllers**
- **Models**
- **Middleware**

This setup not only enhances code readability and maintainability but also establishes a solid foundation for scaling the application as new features are added. During this phase, I also began exploring concepts such as **utils** and **middlewares**, which are crucial for efficient backend development.

### 2. **Node.js Server Setup**
To handle API requests efficiently, I set up a Node.js server using Express. The server is configured to listen on a designated port, enabling smooth communication between the client and server. This setup serves as the backbone for backend operations and will act as a gateway for future API integrations and functionalities.

### 3. **MongoDB Integration**
MongoDB has been successfully integrated into the project to manage data storage efficiently. The integration process involved setting up a connection between the server and the database, which has been thoroughly tested. This step lays the groundwork for robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and ensures reliable data management across the application.

### 4. **Error Handling Implementation**
Recognizing the importance of a resilient application, I implemented basic error-handling mechanisms. These include:
- Clear error messages to improve debugging
- User-friendly feedback to enhance the overall experience

The error-handling setup ensures the application is more reliable and developer-friendly, laying the groundwork for smoother troubleshooting and future enhancements.

---

This milestone marks a significant step forward in the backend development process, and I am excited to continue building on this foundation in future milestones.

# Milestone 4: Livebooks Backend Web Development

by the end of this milestone:

- **Create a User Model**: Think of it as the blueprint for storing user data like name, email, and password in the database.
- **Create a User Controller**: This will help you manage user-related actions like adding new users and fetching their details.
- **Enable and Configure Multer**: Want users to upload profile pictures? Multer’s got your back!
- **Update the README File**: Don’t forget to document your progress here.

---

## What’s the Plan?

### 1. What’s a Model?
A model is like a blueprint. It defines how data is structured in your database. Imagine designing a house—you need a plan first, right?

In MongoDB, we use schemas to define models. For example:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

### 2. What’s a Controller?
Think of a controller as the manager of your app. It decides how to handle incoming requests and what responses to send back.

For example, here’s a simple controller to create a new user:

```javascript
const createUser = (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, password } = req.body;
  const newUser = new User({ name, email, password });

  newUser.save()
    .then(() => res.status(201).send('User created successfully!'))
    .catch(err => res.status(500).send(err));
};

module.exports = { createUser };
```

### 3. File Uploads with Multer
Multer is a game-changer for handling file uploads. It lets users upload files, like profile pictures, to your server.

Here’s how you set it up:

```javascript
const multer = require('multer');

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, 'uploads/');
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, `${Date.now()}-${file.originalname}`);
  }
});

const upload = multer({ storage });
module.exports = upload;
```

---

## Steps to Rock Milestone 4 📝

Here’s the plan:

1. **User Model**: Build and implement the user schema with Mongoose.
2. **User Controller**: Write functions to handle user operations (like creating and retrieving users).
3. **Multer Magic**: Enable file uploads and set up storage for user files.
4. **Document It**: Update this README to reflect your progress.

---

## **Milestone 7!** 🌟  

Today, we’re diving into one of the most important parts of any backend system: user login. The goal here is to validate user credentials and securely verify passwords stored in your database. Let’s make it happen! 🚀  

---

## What I Learned? 🎯

By the end of this milestone, you’ll:  
- Understand how to validate user credentials during login.  
- Learn how to compare encrypted passwords with user inputs securely.

---

## Why Do We Encrypt Passwords? 🛡️

Here’s why password encryption is such a big deal:  
1. **Protect User Data:** Even if the database is compromised, passwords remain safe.  
2. **Privacy:** Passwords won’t be stored in plain text (a major security no-no).  
3. **Compliance:** Meets standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.  
4. **Prevents Password Theft:** Hashed passwords are tough to crack, which keeps things secure.

---

## How Does Login Authentication Work? 🔑

Here’s a quick breakdown of the login process:

1. **User Enters Their Credentials:**  
   - On the login page, users type their email/username and password.

2. **Fetch User Data from the Database:**  
   - The backend checks for the user in the database using the provided email/username.  
   - If no user is found, the system responds: *"User does not exist."*

3. **Compare Encrypted Passwords:**  
   - The system processes the entered password using the same hashing algorithm (like bcrypt).  
   - The hashed password is then compared with the one stored in the database.  
   - If the hashes match, login succeeds. If not, the user gets an error.  

**Fun fact:** Passwords are not "decrypted" because hashing is a one-way process. Instead, hashes are matched!

---

## Steps for Milestone 7 📝

1. **Build the Login Endpoint:**  
   - Accept user credentials (email/username and password).  
   - Retrieve the user’s data from the database.  

2. **Validate the Password:**  
   - Use bcrypt (or a similar library) to hash the input password.  
   - Compare the hashed password to the stored one.  
   - Authenticate the user if they match.

# Milestone 11: Fetch and Display Products 📝

## Overview
In this milestone, we will implement an API endpoint to send all product data to the frontend. On the frontend, we will fetch this data and dynamically render it using the Product Card component.

## Steps to Complete Milestone 11

### Backend (API Endpoint)
1. Create a new API route in your backend server to fetch all product data.
2. Query the database to retrieve all products.
3. Send the product data as a JSON response.

#### Example (Node.js with Express & MongoDB)
```javascript
app.get('/api/products', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const products = await Product.find();
        res.json(products);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: "Error fetching products" });
    }
});
```

### Frontend (Fetching Data & Displaying Products)

1. Write a function to fetch product data from the API.
2. Store the fetched data in a state variable.
3. Pass the data to the Product Card component and render it dynamically.

#### Example (React)
```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import ProductCard from './ProductCard';

const ProductList = () => {
    const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchProducts = async () => {
            try {
                const response = await fetch('/api/products');
                const data = await response.json();
                setProducts(data);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Error fetching products:', error);
            }
        };

        fetchProducts();
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            {products.map(product => (
                <ProductCard key={product._id} product={product} />
            ))}
        </div>
    );
};

export default ProductList;
```

### Product Card Component
Ensure that the `ProductCard` component correctly receives and displays the product data.

```javascript
const ProductCard = ({ product }) => {
    return (
        <div className="product-card">
            <h2>{product.name}</h2>
            <p>{product.description}</p>
            <p>Price: ${product.price}</p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default ProductCard;
```

## Summary
✅ Created an API endpoint to fetch all products.

--

## Steps for Milestone 12 📝

### Backend (Filtering Products by User Email)
1. Create a new API route in the backend to fetch products filtered by the user's email.
2. Query MongoDB to retrieve products that match the logged-in user's email.
3. Send the filtered product data as a JSON response.

#### Example (Node.js with Express & MongoDB)
```javascript
app.get('/api/my-products', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { email } = req.query;
        if (!email) {
            return res.status(400).json({ message: "Email is required" });
        }
        const products = await Product.find({ userEmail: email });
        res.json(products);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: "Error fetching products" });
    }
});
```

### Frontend (Fetching and Displaying User-Specific Products)

1. Write a function to fetch product data for the logged-in user.
2. Store the fetched data in a state variable.
3. Pass the data to the Product Card component and render it dynamically.

#### Example (React)
```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import ProductCard from './ProductCard';

const MyProducts = ({ userEmail }) => {
    const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {

            try {
                const response = await fetch(`/api/my-products?email=${userEmail}`);
                const data = await response.json();
                setProducts(data);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Error fetching products:', error);
            }
        };

        if (userEmail) {
            fetchMyProducts();
        }
    }, [userEmail]);

    return (
        <div>
            {products.map(product => (
                <ProductCard key={product._id} product={product} />
            ))}
        </div>
    );
};

export default MyProducts;
```

### Product Card Component
Ensure that the `ProductCard` component correctly receives and displays the product data.

```javascript
const ProductCard = ({ product }) => {
    return (
        <div className="product-card">
            <h2>{product.name}</h2>
            <p>{product.description}</p>
            <p>Price: ${product.price}</p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default ProductCard;
```

# Milestone 26: Building an Orders Endpoint

Hey there! 👋

This milestone is all about creating an endpoint to fetch a user's orders. Let me walk you through the steps I followed to get this working smoothly.

## 🎯 Goal
The goal is to create an endpoint that takes a user’s email, retrieves their `_id`, and fetches all their orders — then returns those orders in the response.

## 🚀 Steps I Took

1. **Create the Endpoint**  
   - I set up a new route that accepts a `POST` or `GET` request (depending on the API style I’m aiming for) and expects the user’s email in the request body or query params.

2. **Extract User's `_id`**  
   - Using the email provided, I queried the database to fetch the user’s `_id`.  
   - If the email isn’t found, I return a clean, friendly error message — no cryptic errors here! 💪  

3. **Retrieve User's Orders**  
   - Once I had the user’s `_id`, I queried the `orders` collection (or whatever collection I’m using for orders) to pull all orders tied to that user.

4. **Send Back the Orders**  
   - Finally, I bundled the orders into a neat JSON response and sent it back. If no orders were found, I made sure to handle that gracefully with a message like, "Looks like this user hasn’t placed any orders yet."

## 🛠️ Error Handling  
   - **Invalid Email:** If the email doesn’t exist, I made sure to return a 404 with a friendly message.  
   - **No Orders:** If the user exists but hasn’t placed any orders yet, the response still succeeds — but it’s an empty array with a helpful message.  
   - **Server Errors:** I wrapped everything in a try-catch to handle any unexpected issues.

# MileStone 29: PayPal
# Setting Up PayPal for Online Payments

## 1. Create a PayPal Developer Account
First things first, head over to the **PayPal Developer Dashboard** and create a PayPal account if you haven’t already. This will give us access to the developer tools we need.

## 2. Set Up a Sandbox Account
Once you're logged in, navigate to the **Sandbox Accounts** section. Here, you’ll find a test account created by PayPal for development purposes.

- Copy the **User ID** of this sandbox account and save it for later.
- Inside the sandbox account details, locate your **Client ID**, copy it, and keep it safe. We’ll need this soon.

## 3. Implement Payment Options in the Order Confirmation Page
Now, let’s work on adding the payment options to our order confirmation page.

- We need two payment methods:
  1. **Cash on Delivery (COD)**
  2. **Online Payment using PayPal**
- Create radio buttons to let users select between **COD** and **Online Payment**.
- If the user selects **Online Payment**, the PayPal payment buttons should appear dynamically on the page.

# Milestone 31 – Global State Management with Redux 🎯

Hey there! 👋  
This milestone was all about learning how to use Redux for managing global state in a React app. It felt like leveling up from local component state to something way more powerful and scalable.

-

## 🧠 What I Learned

By the end of this, I figured out how to:

- Use **Redux** for global state management across the entire app.
- Set up a **Redux store** to handle shared states (in this case, user email).
- Dispatch actions and write reducers to update that global state cleanly.

-

## 🛠️ Steps I Took

Here’s what I did, step by step:

1. Installed the `react-redux` package using npm.
2. Created a new folder named `store` and added two files:
   - `store.js`
   - `userActions.js`
3. The goal was to store the **user’s email** in a global state.
4. In `store.js`, I configured a Redux store using a `userReducer` function that handles the user email logic.
5. Inside `userActions.js`, I wrote a `setEmail` function to help update the email state globally.
6. Finally, in `index.js`, I wrapped the `App` component with the `<Provider>` component and passed the store as a prop.

# 🧠 Milestone 32 - Follow-Along Project
## 🎯 What I Learned

By completing this milestone, I learned how to:

- Use **Redux** to manage global state in a React application.
- Store data (like email) using the `dispatch` method.
- Access that stored data using `useSelector` across multiple components.

---

## 🛠️ What I Did

1. On the **Login page**, I used `dispatch` to store the user's email in the global Redux state.
2. On the remaining pages, I used `useSelector` to retrieve and use that email wherever needed.
